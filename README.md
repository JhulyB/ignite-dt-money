- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Styled component](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)

- [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)
- [Json server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server/tree/v0)

### What I learned

- Used useCallback to improve performance by memoizing functions like createTransaction and fetchTransactions;
- Applied use-context-selector to optimize context usage;
- Leveraged useMemo to reduce computation in transaction summaries;
- Handled controlled components (e.g., radio groups) using Controller from react-hook-form;
